<h1>FAQ for Rllvm</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> What version of LLVM do I need?
  <dd>
       I am working with llvm-3.2, but have built this with version
  2.7, 2.8, 3.1 of LLVM.

  <dt>
  <li> Where is the documentation?
  <dd>
      There are some vignettes on examples in the tests/ directories.
      These are reasonably comprehensive.
      <p>
      I havent written basic skeletons for the help pages.
      The functions are reasonably similar to the corresponding
      LLVM classes and methods and so you should consult the
      documentation for LLVM and the particular clases and their methods.
      For the time being, send me mail aobut any issues you have
      and I can try to explain what the functions are intended
      to do. That will prompt me to write more R-oriented documentation.
      </p>
