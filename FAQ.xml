I want to compile <omg:pkg>Rllvm</omg:pkg> with a local, non-centrally installed
version of llvm, e.g. a development version that I build in my own account area
and not the one in that is installed /usr/local/.  What do I have to do?

The first thing to do is set the environment variable LLVM_CONFIG 
to the full path to the local version of llvm-config you want to use,
e.g.
<sh:code>
export LLVM_CONFIG=~/LLVM/build/Debug+Asserts/bin/llvm-config
</sh:code>
Here I have put the source for llvm in LLVM/llvm, and configured
and built it from a directory named build/.

If you have a version of llvm installed  in /usr/local, 
you will need to force the local library directory to come before
/usr/local/lib when building the shared library. R doesn't make
this especially customizable, so we can force it by setting
the Make variable SHLIB_LINK in our own local Makevars
file in <sh:path>${HOME}/.R</sh:path>, i.e. <sh:path>${HOME}/.R./Makevars</sh:path>.
We can do this with
<sh:code>
SHLIB_LINK= $(SHLIB_LD) $(shell $(LLVM_CONFIG) --ldflags) $(SHLIB_LDFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
</sh:code>
</para>

The last step is, of course, to ensure the system loader  finds your 
local versions of the libraries. You need to set
<sh:var>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</sh:var>, or <sh:var>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</sh:var>
on OS X, or <sh:var>PATH</sh:var> on Windows, to point to
the lib/ directory in your build, e.g.
<sh:code>
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/LLVM/build/lib/
</sh:code>
